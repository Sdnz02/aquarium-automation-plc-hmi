# Aquarium Automation System using TIA Portal 

This repository contains a complete PLC-HMI-based automation system for an aquarium, developed using **TIA Portal**. The system demonstrates how Siemens PLCs and HMI panels can be used to automate and monitor aquarium operations such as lighting, feeding, and temperature regulation.

The project serves as an educational example for integrating automation hardware and software in a real-world-like scenario.

## Objectives

- Automate routine tasks in an aquarium (lighting, feeding, thermal control).
- Monitor system parameters and control outputs via HMI.
- Simulate industrial automation with TIA Portal.
- Demonstrate integration of Siemens PLC with an HMI panel.
