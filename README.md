# Aquarium PLC & HMI Automation Project 

This repository hosts a complete industrial automation project designed for managing and monitoring an aquarium environment using PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) and HMI (Human-Machine Interface) technologies.

The system simulates real-world automation by integrating control logic, graphical interface design, and simulated sensor feedbackâ€”offering a comprehensive example of embedded system development in the context of smart aquariums.

## Project Objectives

- Automate routine aquarium maintenance tasks (lighting, feeding, temperature control).
- Provide real-time monitoring and manual override via an HMI panel.
- Simulate industrial automation logic for educational demonstration.
- Improve operational efficiency, reduce manual intervention, and enhance aquatic life health.
